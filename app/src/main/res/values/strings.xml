        The game of life is a game where we simulated the life of cells.
        The board contain multiple cells that can die or create other cells.
        The Rules:
            For a space where a cell is alive:
                Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
                Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
                Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
        For a space that don\'t contain any living cell
            Each space with three neighbors becomes populated.
